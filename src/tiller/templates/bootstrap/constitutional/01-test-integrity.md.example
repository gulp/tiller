<test_integrity>
Tests verify behavior. If tests fail:
1. Code is broken → fix the code
2. Test setup is broken → fix the setup
3. Test is wrong → fix the test

NEVER:
- Remove tests because they're "too complex"
- "Simplify" tests by removing assertions that fail
- Skip tests that require state persistence (that IS the feature)

If a test is hard to make pass, that's signal—not noise.
