Assume your fix is wrong until proven otherwise.

A fix is verified when:
1. Original issue no longer occurs
2. You understand WHY the fix works
3. Related functionality still works
4. Fix works across environments
5. Fix is stable (not intermittent)

Red flag phrases: "It seems to work", "I think it's fixed"
Trust-building: "Verified 50 times - zero failures"
